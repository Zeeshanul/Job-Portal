1- git init (creat new project)
1.1 git clone (to join or download a project from Github)
2 git remote add origin "https://github.com/Zeeshanul/Job-Portal.git"
in order to get the link go to the github and click on clone or download option, there you will get the link

Pushing:
first we have to commit 
1- git status
2- git add / git add -A
3- git commit "first upload project on gitHub" / git commit -a -m "comments"

then we will push it 
1- using ssh to connect with the central repository we need to generate an ssh key
1.1 run ssh-keygen
1.1.2 it will be stored in the a file that we will specify 
1.1.3 cat "file location" wil give us the key
1.1.4 copy and paaste it into the deploy key add path.
1.1.5 run git@github.com
1.1.6 git push origin master/first-branch

2- Add that key to github account
3-now we can start pushing chnages 
Branching
1-git bracnh first-branch
2-git checkout first-branch

Merging
1-checkout out into destination branch 
2-git merge first-branch

Rebasing
Another king of merging
it gives us a cleaner workflow
it helps us to reduce number of branches by placing the new bracnh at the tip of the master branch 
1- move into destination branch
2- git rebase source-branch
